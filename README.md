=========
Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) is a novel semantic approach to grammatical representation. It was developed in the Computational Linguistics Lab of the Computer Science Department of the Hebrew University by Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport.

For more information about UCCA, see http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/oabend/ucca.html

This project contains Java code for reading and manipulating the UCCA structures.

The code was written by Daniel Hershcovich (danielh@cs.huji.ac.il).
